** Installation
*** The 1st Method
    You need to run the commands at below:
    #+begin_src shell
      mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d-bak && git clone https://github.com/KiteAB/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d && cd ~/.emacs.d && mkdir site-lisp gtd

    #+end_src

*** 2nd Method
    You need to run the ~make install~ in the terminal or manually run the commands written in the ~Makefile~

    And enjoy the Emacs!

** Shortcuts
   I binded the ~C-z~ key to be the user defined key.

   ~C-z~ key bind the functions in ~etc/init-functions.el~

   You can view this file and change somethings.

** Notes
   - This configuration file is use ~use-package~
   - This configuration file is extend by [[https://github.com/SpringHan/.emacs.d][SpringHan/.emacs.d]], you can use that configuration too.
*** Todos
    - Use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] are not [[https://github.com/SpringHan/.emacs.d/blob/master/etc/init-require-package.el][package-require]] (almost done)
    - Add some useful functions and bind to ~C-z~ keys group.
